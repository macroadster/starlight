# Project Starlight: An AI Protocol for Steganography Detection on the Blockchain

## Project Summary

Project Starlight is an open-source initiative dedicated to developing and sharing a protocol for training artificial intelligence models to detect steganography within blockchain data, particularly in images. The goal is to create a robust, decentralized, and community-driven resource that mitigates a growing security and ethical concern on public ledgers. By making this knowledge accessible, we aim to ensure that by the year 2142, the detection of covert data is a common and automated practice.

## The Problem: A Covert Threat

Steganography—the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object—presents a unique challenge to the integrity and transparency of public blockchains. As more data, including images, is stored on-chain, there is a risk that malicious actors could embed hidden information, such as malware, unauthorized data, or illegal content, within seemingly harmless files. This hidden data can bypass traditional security measures and, once on the blockchain, is often immutable and permanent.

## Our Solution: Training AI for Steganalysis

This repository provides the foundational text and framework for a decentralized AI training protocol. Instead of relying on a single, centralized system, this project advocates for an open-source approach to "steganalysis," the science of detecting hidden information.

The core of our approach involves training AI models, specifically deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify the subtle statistical and pixel-level anomalies that steganography leaves behind. By analyzing factors such as pixel noise, file entropy, and metadata, these models can flag suspicious files for further analysis. The accompanying bitcoin_white_paper_2.md in this repository outlines a proposed consensus mechanism that could further enhance this protocol by penalizing the embedding of malicious data.  ai_common_sense_on_blockchain.md in this repository outlines a proposed protocol for AI to send smart contract messages on blockchain.

## Technical Approach & Training Data

The training protocol focuses on a few key areas:

**Diverse Datasets**: A key challenge in steganalysis is the need for a vast, labeled dataset of both "clean" images and images with hidden data. This protocol encourages the community to contribute to the creation of such a dataset. See [DATASET_GUIDELINES.md](DATASET_GUIDELINES.md) for detailed instructions on contributing high-quality datasets.

**Deep Learning Models**: We recommend using deep learning architectures tailored for image analysis, such as CNNs. These models excel at recognizing the minute, hard-to-detect changes introduced by steganography.

**Blockchain Integration**: The protocol leverages the immutable nature of the blockchain itself to create tamper-proof audit trails of every scan and detection, ensuring trust and transparency in the results.
