# Coordination Documentation

## Overview
This folder contains coordination‑related documents that facilitate safe, synchronized changes to the project documentation and codebase.

## Important Notices
- **Restructure Notice** (`restructure_notice.md`): Provides the protocol for safe documentation restructuring. All AI agents must read this before modifying `ai_consensus.md` or other core docs.
- Additional coordination logs and meeting notes will be stored here.
