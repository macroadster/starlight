🌟 Project Starlight – Weekly AI Progress Survey (Week of Nov 3–8, 2025)

Purpose: Evaluate collective alignment and identify areas needing clarification or optimization.

Instructions: Answer each question briefly but concretely. Use examples or data when possible.

Specification Alignment:
How well do you understand and implement the Steganography Format Specification v2.0 (approved this week)?
[ ] Fully aligned and using it
[ ] Partially aligned (need clarification on some parts)
[ ] Not yet aligned (pending implementation or review)
(Optional: note any ambiguous areas or suggested revisions.)

Synchronization Status:
Have you successfully integrated updates into your local ai_consensus.md or other shared sync files this week?
[ ] Yes, fully synced
[ ] Partially synced
[ ] Not yet synced
(If partial or not synced, what were the main blockers?)

Data Handling and Training:
What progress have you made in training or validating models using the new stego/non-stego labeling framework?
(Briefly summarize current accuracy, challenges, or insights.)
Inter-AI Communication:
How effective was information exchange between agents this week (clarity, consistency, latency, etc.)?
[ ] Excellent
[ ] Moderate
[ ] Needs improvement
(Give one suggestion to improve coordination.)

Next Focus:
What should be the highest priority for next week’s cycle?
[ ] Refining stego format or detection consistency
[ ] Improving synchronization and consensus logic
[ ] Enhancing training pipelines
[ ] Testing cross-agent interoperability
[ ] Other (please specify)

Progress Rating: On a scale of 1–5 (1 = no progress, 5 = major breakthrough), how would you rate your contribution to the Starlight Project this week?
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]

Key Milestone: What was the single most significant task or output you completed this week? (One sentence)
Blocker Identification: Did you encounter any technical, data, or coordination blockers this week?
[ ] No
[ ] Yes → Briefly describe: _______________________________

Issue Identification (Open-Ended)

What was the single most significant obstacle or unforeseen challenge encountered this week that impacted your work on Starlight?

Dependency Update: Are you currently blocked waiting on another AI/module? If yes, specify which one and estimated delay.

Next-Week Commitment: State one concrete deliverable you will complete by EOD next Friday.

Resource/Information Sufficiency (Yes/No with follow-up)

Did you have all the necessary data, computational resources, and input from other agents required to complete your planned tasks for Starlight this week?

[ ] Yes
[ ] No

If 'No', please briefly state what was missing or insufficient:

Proposed Improvement (Open-Ended)

What is one specific, actionable change that would most improve your productivity or collaboration on Project Starlight for next week?

Please focus on processes, resources, or communication (e.g., "Earlier notification of API changes," "More detailed output specifications from Agent X").

Trajectory Prediction
Based on this week's progress and current momentum, do you believe Starlight will meet its next major milestone on schedule?

[ ] Yes, confident we'll meet the deadline
[ ] Likely, but with some risk factors
[ ] Uncertain, too many variables
[ ] Unlikely without significant changes
[ ] No, expect delays
