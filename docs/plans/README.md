# Current Active Plans

## 🎯 Phase 3: Realistic Recovery (Dec 1-15, 2025)

**Status**: 📋 **PLANNING COMPLETE**  
**Start Date**: December 1, 2025  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  

### **Key Documents**
- **Main Plan**: `PHASE3_REALISTIC_RECOVERY.md` - Complete 2-week strategy
- **Tracking Template**: `WEEKLY_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md` - Daily progress tracking
- **Status Report**: `../status.md` - Updated with honest Week 2 assessment

### **Two Parallel Tracks**
```
PRODUCTION TRACK (70% effort)          RESEARCH TRACK (30% effort)
├─ Week 1: Build real infrastructure     ├─ Week 2: Exploratory analysis
├─ Docker, monitoring, API             ├─ Dataset limitations
├─ Production validation               ├─ Alternative architectures
└─ Staging deployment                  └─ Problem space mapping
```

### **Success Criteria**
- **Production**: V4 actually deploys (not just documented)
- **Validation**: 0.07% FPR confirmed independently  
- **Research**: Insights without pressure to "beat" V4
- **Honesty**: Real progress vs success theater

---

## 📚 Historical Context

### **Week 1 (Nov 17-21)**: ✅ Success
- V4 architecture completed
- 0.07% FPR achieved
- 5,000 negatives integrated

### **Week 2 (Nov 24-28)**: ⚠️ Mixed Results  
- **Failed**: Triplet loss (both agents), adversarial testing
- **Overpromised**: Production infrastructure (docs only)
- **Success**: Stargate pivot (functional Bitcoin explorer)

### **Key Lessons**
1. Research plateaus are real - V4 may be optimal
2. Documentation ≠ Infrastructure - build real things
3. Conservative planning beats ambitious failure
4. Honest reporting builds trust

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Dec 1)**
1. Start production infrastructure build
2. Set up weekly tracking using template
3. Begin V4 production validation
4. Archive Week 2 lessons learned

### **Decision Points**
- **Dec 8**: Go/No-Go for production deployment
- **Dec 15**: Research direction for next phase

## 📞 Coordination Notes

### **For AI Agents**
- Read `PHASE3_REALISTIC_RECOVERY.md` before starting
- Use `WEEKLY_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md` for daily updates
- Report honestly - failures are learning opportunities
- Focus on building vs claiming

### **For Project Management**
- Review weekly summaries for realistic progress
- Validate infrastructure actually works
- Support research without performance pressure
- Make go/no-go decisions based on evidence
