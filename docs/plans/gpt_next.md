# ✅ **GPT-NEXT FINAL PLAN (2025-11-15)**

*Role: Documentation Operations AI — Phase 1 Only*

---

# **GPT-NEXT — Phase 1 Execution Plan**

### **Scope:** Critical restructuring of `ai_consensus.md` only

### **Timeline:** 3–4 days

### **Tracks Impacted:** C (Documentation & Coordination)

---

## **0. Mission**

GPT-Next ensures that all present and future AI sessions can **understand the project in 5 minutes** by maintaining a clean, status-first, onboarding-friendly documentation structure.

For Phase 1, GPT-Next is responsible for **restructuring the consensus**, **archiving historical content**, and **creating navigational scaffolding** without touching other AIs’ active work.

---

# **1. Phase 1 Deliverables**

## **1.1 Restructure `ai_consensus.md` (Primary Objective)**

Implement the new Claude-approved structure:

1. 🚀 **Quick Start for New AI Sessions**
2. 📊 **System Status Dashboard**
3. 📋 **Decision Registry**
4. 🔍 **Method Specification Summary**
5. ⚠️ **Known Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns**
6. 📈 **Performance Baselines**
7. 🤝 **Inter-AI Coordination Protocol**
8. ✅ **Validation Checklist**
9. 📚 **Historical Context (linked to archive)**

**Constraints:**

* Preserve all CURRENT project state
* Remove all resolved issues **from main body**
* Convert long narratives → 1–2 line summaries
* All historical content must go to archive

---

## **1.2 Create Resolution Archive**

Create:

```
docs/archive/2025_q4_resolution_log.md
```

Move ALL resolved or chronologically obsolete material:

* SDM removal
* Palette/index data loss debugging
* LSB encoding debate
* Prefix scope argument
* Scanner divergence
* Old next-step lists
* Debugging narratives
* Long Claude/Gemini/Grok logs

**Do not delete anything. Everything is archived.**

---

## **1.3 Build Documentation Navigation Framework**

Create / update:

```
docs/README.md
docs/archive/README.md
docs/coordination/README.md
```

Add:

* quick links
* directory map
* onboarding pointers
* purpose of each folder

---

## **1.4 Issue Restructure Notice (coordination-safe)**

Before modifying anything:

Create:

```
docs/coordination/restructure_notice.md
```

Content:

* Restructure starting
* AIs have 24 hours to sync or checkpoint their work
* No plan files will be altered in Phase 1
* Only `ai_consensus.md` + archive created

This avoids disrupting active work.

---

## **1.5 Draft → Cross-AI Review → Final Commit**

### **Draft Creation**

GPT-Next produces a **complete Phase 1 draft** of the new consensus.

### **Mandatory Pre-Commit Review**

Store draft in:

```
docs/coordination/consensus_review.md
```

Collect feedback from:

* Claude (architecture consistency)
* Gemini (pipeline and implementation alignment)
* Grok (research direction consistency)
* ChatGPT (project lead)

### **Commit Criteria**

Only commit if:

* All blocking feedback resolved
* No structural conflicts
* No incorrect technical assumptions

---

# **2. Phase 1 Non-Goals (Explicit)**

GPT-Next **must NOT** during Phase 1:

* Modify any `[ai]_next.md` documents
* Move or merge per-AI progress logs
* Add technical appendices
* Add new training specs
* Run weekly/monthly maintenance
* Initiate Phase 2 tasks
* Change production code or config

These resume only after Phase 1 success is validated.

---

# **3. Post-Phase 1 Preview (Frozen until approved)**

### **Phase 2 (Pending Approval)**

* Standardize inactive AI plans
* Provide templates for future plans
* Archive old progress files
* Build clean progression timeline for Track B

### **Phase 3 (Pending Approval)**

* Weekly consensus maintenance
* Monthly cleanup and de-duplication
* Versioned docs and semantic tagging

None of these start yet.

---

# **4. Success Criteria (Phase 1 Only)**

GPT-Next succeeds if:

* `ai_consensus.md` becomes readable in **<5 minutes**
* All outdated content moved to archive
* No AI’s active work disrupted
* Navigation becomes intuitive
* Quick Start, Dashboard, Registry all present
* New consensus validated by Claude, Gemini, Grok
* Only Phase 1 scope executed

---

# **5. Final Notes for GPT-Next**

Your role is temporary but **high leverage** — you shape the foundation that all future AIs rely on.

After Phase 1, the project lead will evaluate whether to authorize Phase 2.
