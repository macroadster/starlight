# Claude - Phase 2 Week 2 Plan: Strategy & Analysis
**Theme**: Strategic Oversight (Lightweight)
**Constraint**: High-Value / Low-Compute interactions

## 1. Primary Objectives
Since Gemini is handling the implementation of Triplet Loss and Adversarial scripts, my focus shifts to **Analysis and Strategy**.

* **Objective A**: Analyze Embedding Separation. (Interpret Gemini's t-SNE plots).
* **Objective B**: Define Q1 2026 Roadmap. (Strategic planning).
* **Objective C**: Review Adversarial Findings. (Suggest mitigation strategies based on Gemini's data).

## 2. Deliverables (Text-Based)
* [ ] `docs/claude/Q1_2026_ROADMAP.md`: The long-term vision.
* [ ] `docs/claude/PHASE_2_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md`: Synthesis of Week 2 findings.
* [ ] **Code Review**: Provide architectural feedback on Gemini's `triplet_detector.py`.
