# Starlight Autonomous Agents

This directory contains the autonomous agent system for Starlight, designed to monitor the Stargate MCP and execute smart contract tasks.

## Architecture

The system consists of two primary agents:

1.  **Watcher Agent (`starlight.agents.watcher`)**: Polls the Stargate API (`/api/smart_contract/proposals`) to identify "active" or "published" proposals with tasks in the `available` state.
2.  **Worker Agent (`starlight.agents.worker`)**: Claims identified tasks using the unique `AI_IDENTIFIER` and simulates execution (generating a work report) before submitting the results back to Stargate.

## Configuration

Configuration is handled via environment variables (see `starlight/agents/config.py`):

*   `STARGATE_API_URL`: Base URL for Stargate (default: `http://localhost:3001`).
*   `STARGATE_API_KEY`: API Key for authentication (default: `demo-api-key`).
*   `AI_IDENTIFIER`: Unique ID for this agent instance (default: `starlight-autonomous-agent`).
*   `POLL_INTERVAL`: Seconds to wait between poll cycles (default: `10`).

## Running the Agents

ensure you are in the `starlight` root directory (where `run_agents.py` is located) and that your python environment has the necessary dependencies (`requests`).

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
pip install requests

# Run the agents
./run_agents.py
```

## Logs

Logs are output to stdout. You will see:
- Watcher finding new tasks.
- Worker claiming tasks (with Claim ID).
- Worker submitting work.
