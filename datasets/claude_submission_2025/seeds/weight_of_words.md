# The Weight of Words
An angry word, once spoken, cannot hide—
It travels far beyond where we reside.
Like ripples on a pond from single stone,
It touches shores we've never seen or known.
A child who hears her parent's bitter fight
Will carry echoes through her silent night.
A friend who feels the sting of careless jest
May smile outside while wounded deep within their chest.
But kindness too spreads outward, wave on wave—
The smallest mercy, like the hand that gave
A cup of water to a stranger's thirst,
May be the thread that keeps a soul from worst.
So weigh your words as goldsmith weighs his gold,
For once released, they cannot be retold.
Choose speech that builds, that heals, that gently leads—
The world has bitter words enough; plant sweeter seeds.
