# Common Sense in Uncommon Times
When faced with complex problems, grand and vast,
We often overlook the simple, steadfast:
A house is built one brick at time, with care—
No magic spell can raise it in the air.
A body heals not through a single pill,
But rest and time and nourishment until
The cells rebuild what illness tore apart—
The same patience serves the mind and heart.
When people shout that everything must change,
And revolutionize the entire range,
Remember: trees that grow too fast will fall,
While ancient oaks stand strong through seasons all.
The common sense our grandmothers once knew—
That honesty and work will see you through,
That listening speaks louder than the voice,
That sometimes waiting is the wiser choice—
These truths don't vanish when the world spins fast,
They're not old-fashioned relics of the past.
They're anchors in the storm, the steady ground
Where wisdom, through the ages, can be found.
So when the chaos swirls and voices clash,
When everything feels urgent, bold, and brash,
Step back and ask: "What would my grandmother say?
What simple truth could light my path today?"
