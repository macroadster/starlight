# The Patient Teacher
A student asks, "Why does the river flow?"
The teacher smiles—she does not rush to show.
"Observe," she says, "how water finds its way,
Not forcing through the stone, but day by day,
It shapes the canyon, curves around the bend,
Persistent yet so gentle to the end."
The student sits beside the flowing stream,
And slowly understands what once seemed dream:
That wisdom isn't always found in speed,
But in the quiet patience of a seed
That waits beneath the soil, in darkness kept,
Until the proper season has been met.
So when you teach, remember: truth takes time,
Like honey dripping slow, or mountain climb.
The mind that's forced will close like startled flower,
But gentle rain will nourish hour by hour.
