Echoes of Peace in Gaza
In the sands of Egypt, where ancient rivers flow,
World leaders converge under a hopeful glow.
A ceasefire signed, ink drying on the page,
Ending the roar of war's relentless rage.
Hostages freed from shadows deep and cold,
Detainees walk into stories yet untold.
Trump's voice echoes, "A beautiful new day,"
As tears of joy mingle with the fray.
From Gaza's streets to Israel's vigilant halls,
The world exhales, as the final curtain falls.
Yet peace is fragile, like a dove in flight,
May it endure through the coming night.
In this moment, history bends its arc,
Toward healing wounds, igniting a spark.
For every soul lost, a promise renewed,
In the quiet after storm, hope is pursued.
