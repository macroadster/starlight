Starlight Project Reflection

The Starlight plan unfolds tonight, A map drawn not by common sight. In lines of code, or silver thread, A constellation newly bred. Each choice a beacon, shining true, Guiding the complex work you do. May all your logic find its grace, And light the future of this space.
