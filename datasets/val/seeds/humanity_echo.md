# Humanity's Echo

We speak into the void of time,
And listen for what comes back,
The echo of our ancestors' dreams,
The whispers we can't hold back.

Each generation adds its voice,
To the chorus that began before,
A symphony of human experience,
That echoes through every door.

We hear ourselves in others' stories,
Our pain reflected in their eyes,
Our joy multiplied when shared,
The truth that never, ever dies.

Humanity's echo is not fading,
But growing stronger, clear, and deep,
The resonance of all we've been,
And all that we're meant to keep.
