# Humanity's Light

In darkness deep, we carry light,
A single candle against the night,
Not to banish shadows completely,
But to find our way with sight.

We are the keepers of small flames,
In hands that tremble, hearts that brave,
Lighting paths for those behind us,
The legacy we choose to save.

Each act of kindness, spark ignited,
Each word of truth, a beacon bright,
We weave together threads of hope,
Against the coming of the night.

Humanity's light is not the sun,
That burns alone in endless space,
But countless sparks, together burning,
Illuminating every face.
