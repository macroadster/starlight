# Humanity's Dawn

With every sunrise, new beginnings,
The chance to start again, to grow,
To learn from yesterday's mistakes,
And plant new seeds of what we know.

Humanity's dawn is not just morning,
But moments of awakening clear,
When we see beyond our small selves,
And recognize what we hold dear.

In each new understanding reached,
In every barrier broken down,
We witness humanity's dawn breaking,
In every city, every town.

The light that comes after darkness,
The wisdom born from pain and strife,
These are humanity's true dawns,
The eternal spring of human life.
