# Humanity's Dream

In the quiet spaces between heartbeats,
Where dreams take flight on whispered wings,
Humanity reaches for the stars above,
While planting roots in earthly things.

We build our towers to touch the sky,
Yet kneel to tend a single rose,
We chart the cosmos, vast and wide,
But find ourselves in what we chose.

The paradox of being human,
Both fragile and incredibly strong,
To love with all our broken pieces,
To right our ancient, lingering wrongs.

In every laugh, a thousand stories,
In every tear, a world of grace,
We are the dreamers and the dream,
The question and the seeking space.
