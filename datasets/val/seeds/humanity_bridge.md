# Humanity's Bridge

We build bridges between hearts,
With words and deeds and silent care,
Spanning chasms of difference,
Connecting everywhere to everywhere.

Each hand extended in friendship,
Each ear that listens without judgment,
Each voice that speaks for the voiceless,
Are pillars of our testament.

We cross from isolation to community,
From fear to understanding, slow but sure,
The bridge of humanity is built of love,
And strengthened by the pure.

No single soul can build it all,
But together we create the way,
A span across what divides us,
Where dawn follows every gray.
