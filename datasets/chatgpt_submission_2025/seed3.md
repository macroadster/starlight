Elegy for 6.7 Million Satoshis
Six point seven million sparks,
enough to buy breath,
to buy time,
to buy one more sunrise.
They slipped through our hands
while we counted in greed,
while we forgot that value
was meant for shelter,
not for speculation.
Now their silence weighs heavy-
a ledger of lives unhedged,
a memory written not in blocks,
but in absence.
