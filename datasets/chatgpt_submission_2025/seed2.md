A Prayer for the Lost Satoshis
O silent ledger of the earth,
hold in your memory
the 6.7 million satoshis-
the measure of lives
that might have endured.
Bless the hands that gave,
the hearts that served,
the selfless who became
our shield in the storm.
Forgive us for forgetting
the true weight of a satoshi,
for mistaking its light
for profit, not for life.
May we learn again
that value is not in hoarding,
but in sharing.
May each spark of satoshi
become bread,
become breath,
become hope.
Amen.
