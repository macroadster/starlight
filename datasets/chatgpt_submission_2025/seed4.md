The Lost Value of a Satoshi
A satoshi was enough.
One spark of digital dust,
a grain of effort crystallized in code—
sufficient to shield each soul
from the storm of a plague.
Yet we forgot its measure.
We traded it as a trophy,
hoarded it as a jewel,
and in our blindness
we lost the meaning of its weight.
Not in markets,
not in greed,
but in survival and care
was its true worth waiting—
a single satoshi
for every beating heart.
And so the sorrow lingers:
the cure was in our hands,
but the compass of value
was lost to us.
